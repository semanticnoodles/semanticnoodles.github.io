## About

For the 2023 annual meeting of ASIS&T I submitted **Investigating the intersections of Ethics and Artificial Intelligence in the Collections as Data Position Papers**. This poster encapsulated some of the preliminary findings stemming from the ongoing research I am currently conducting as part of my Ph.D. journey. At this point in time I do not have much written (nor this new website of mine finished), but I can tell you that I am investigating the developments of the Collections as Data movement and the idea of responsibly releasing collections that are “amenable to computation”. 

In the meantime, have a look at some of the poster extras!

### The #BetterPoster format

You may have noticed that the layout of my poster might appear somewhat unconventional, unless you are already acquainted with the innovative **#BetterPoster format**. 

This format was introduced by Mike Morrison in a video hosted on the #BetterScience channel. The aim of this atypical poster design is to enhance the visual appeal and effectiveness of scientific communication, offering a fresh perspective on how to convey complex information in a more engaging and less cluttered manner.

This is the first time ever I use it and, although I am not sure I will be using this format again, it has been quite the experience and a bit of a challenge. If you want to know more about the concept behind the design have a look at the seminal video or go directly to the **OSF directory** that hosts the templates: <a href="https://osf.io/ef53g/">https://osf.io/ef53g/
