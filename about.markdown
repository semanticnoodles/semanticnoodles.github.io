Born in Ferrara in 1988 and **grew up in a garden**, at 3 years old, I fell in love with informatics and dinosaurs. At age 8, I discovered my deep fascination for archaeology; that was the period I realized that I wanted to work with ancient stuff, green things, and computers. At 16 years old, I started drawing digitally, **developing some graphic design skills** that came in handy years later when I started working as a visual designer.

I obtained a bachelor's and a master's degree in Quaternary, Prehistory, and Archaeology at the University of Ferrara, **with both my dissertations focused on plants**. After 3 years spent engaging with community archaeology and graphics-related projects, I felt there was something missing. I had a bee in my bonnet; I wanted more scientific knowledge to balance my profile, in order to understand in which field to pursue an academic career.

So I began another master's, this time in Biodiversity and Evolution, at the University of Bologna. **I specialized in Botany and earned an Erasmus + scholarship for 10 months, which I spent at the University of León, Spain**.

On June 2020, I suspended my academic career in biology to become an Early Stage Researcher at the EU-funded ERA Chair “Mnemosyne” project, in which I have been researching **Semantic Data Modeling for Digital Cultural Heritage**.

Then, almost a year later, **I started my Ph.D. at the University College Dublin, with a unique focus on the relationship between digital curation practices and artificial intelligence**.
