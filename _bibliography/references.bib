	abstract = {Social distancing is currently the international disease control standard as a response to the spread of Covid-19. This situation has brought many significant challenges to Cultural Heritage (CH) professionals and associated institutions. Although physical patronage at museums has dropped significantly, there are opportunities for retaining and possibly increasing viewership by using the latest virtual reality technology (VR) and other advanced multimedia tools. To be better informed, it is helpful to look at sectors outside of CH that have made an effective integration of these systems and methods. A comparative precedent is the international medical sector, which actively employs advanced VR for education, research and daily practice. The field has been highly active in the integration of VR to effectively address issues such as enhanced training, communication, public/professional engagement and remote access. 

For both CH and medicine, developing VR content is time-consuming, and the associated computer hardware and associated exhibition equipment can be exceptionally expensive. By drawing upon state-of-the-art research and applied activities from the field of medicine, the proposed paper will look at specific precedents that would be of direct interest and benefit to CH. Looking at methods such as digital documentation, virtualization, 3D presentation, AR interaction, haptic systems, and other VR tools.

The suggested topics will be discussed within the framework of the EU ERA Chair in Digital CH, project “MNEMOSYNE”, which aims to propose systems, guidelines, and standards for the holistic documentation of Digital Cultural Heritage.},

	abstract = {Purpose This study aims to explore the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in archival practice by presenting the thoughts and opinions of working archival practitioners. It contributes to the extant literature with a fresh perspective, expanding the discussion on AI adoption by investigating how it influences the perceptions of digital archival expertise. Design/methodology/approach In this study a two-phase data collection consisting of four online focus groups was held to gather the opinions of international archives and digital preservation professionals (n = 16), that participated on a volunteer basis. The qualitative analysis of the transcripts was performed using template analysis, a style of thematic analysis. Findings Four main themes were identified: fitting AI into day to day practice; the responsible use of (AI) technology; managing expectations (about AI adoption) and bias associated with the use of AI. The analysis suggests that AI adoption combined with hindsight about digitisation as a disruptive technology might provide archival practitioners with a framework for re-defining, advocating and outlining digital archival expertise. Research limitations/implications The volunteer basis of this study meant that the sample was not representative or generalisable. Originality/value Although the results of this research are not generalisable, they shed light on the challenges prospected by the implementation of AI in the archives and for the digital curation professionals dealing with this change. The evolution of the characterisation of digital archival expertise is a topic reserved for future research.},

	abstract = {Memory organisations need to constantly address the adoption of digital technology to remain relevant in light of recent innovations that constitute the so-called fourth technological revolution. This study aims to expand the understanding of the current adoption of Artificial Intelligence for digital preservation tasks by investigating it through the lenses of the Diffusion of Innovations theory in relation to disruptive innovations. The analysis takes the form of an exploratory qualitative inquiry, performed on the transcripts of four focus groups presenting opinions on specific applications of Artificial Intelligence systems, mostly related to Computer Vision, expressed by professionals engaged in digital preservation. The study results indicate that there is strong interest in adopting these innovations. However, further research and the development of a dialogue among the involved communities of practice are necessary to determine the implications and potential outcomes of this technological advancement in the context of digital preservation.},
